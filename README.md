# CalCalc

CalCalc is a program that runs in the browser that allows you to more easily calculate what you will earn that month.
This is calculated using your own customizable config and getting your google calender using the Google API.

## TODO

There are still a bit of work that needs to be done. Here is a short list of things that are planned.
* Customize the config on the website.
* Save config in the url for easier utilization.
* Personal customization of to and from date for payment.
* Set bank holidays and other special days with custom wage.
* Specificy additional wage, or set rate for days.
* See multiple months at once.
* Style the website
* Document functions better
